        China's space industry was launched in 1956. Over the past decades, China's space industry has created one
        miracle after
        another. In 1970 China launched its first man-made earth satellite, ranking China the fifth country in the world
        to
        independently develop and launch man-made earth satellites. In 1992 China began to carry out the manned
        spaceflight
        program. In 2003 China launched Shenzhou-5, a manned spaceship. The successful launch made China the third
        country to
        launch manned spaceships. In 2007 Chang'e-1, the first lunar-orbiting man-made satellite, was sent to space. In
        2013
        Shenzhou-10, the fifth manned spaceship, was launched successfully, laying the foundation for building the
        Chinese Space
        Station.
